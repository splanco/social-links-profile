## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I think my main takeaway from this lesson was creating a generic CSS class that can be given to multiple elements that serve the same purpose. I also learned how to use the min(), max(), and clamp() functions to make my page more responsive.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to focus on increasing the responsiveness of my web pages. Utilizzing the resources given within native CSS is still somewhat confusing to me, so I think repeated use will allow me to gain some intuition on how they work.

### Useful resources

- [CSS min(), max(), and clamp()](https://web.dev/articles/min-max-clamp) - An easy to follow guide on the aformentioned functions with great examples.
